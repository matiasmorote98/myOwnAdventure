    <h1>Venice, Italy</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to Venice, Italy. This is an iconic city, completely on water you have to travel by boat to any destination. The city is also known for being home of some of the biggest jewelry stores in the world. Your job is to go to the one I have chosen for you and steal all that you can AND NOT GET CAUGHT!! Do you want to go in loud and guns blazin or quiet and stealthy?
